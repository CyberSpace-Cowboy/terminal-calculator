# Terminal Calculator

This is a very trivial calculator app that works inside a terminal/command prompt, I wrote it in less than 15 minutes using Python.

## Implementation 

It's implemented in the most trivial way possible:

1. It outputs a menu for you with all the instructions and commands
2. You can type your calculations using '+', '-', '*', '/', '^' operators
3. You can exit the program at any time by typing 'exit' or 'exit' and then hit Enter

It's extremely trivial, but it works.
